I'm Jonathan, an economist by profession and I've always been very interested in sustainability.

Recently I started to learn more about nutrition: reading books, taking courses, watching videos, etc... and it was then when I realized the huge impact our diets have on the environment. This is what has moved me to carry out the project you are seeing.

Apart from that, I have a business background and I am passionate about numbers, graphs, analytics, etc... which is what led me to specialize in Data Science. I believe that knowing how to interpret data correctly from a mathematical/statistical perspective leads you not only to understand the world in a different way but also to communicate more effectively and efficiently.
