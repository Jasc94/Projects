**Food groups**

Filters:

- Below this expander, you have another expander where you must choose the food groups to be shown

Output: You will see four plots
- Top left: % of the recommended daily intake that the chosen food groups fulfill
- Top right: Sugar, carbs & fats (in grams). For the fats you will see "Fatty acid, total saturated", "Fatty acids, total monounsaturated" and "Fatty acis, total polyunsaturated". The sum of these three equals "Total Fat"
- Bottom left: Cholesterol (in miligrams)
- Bottom right: Energy as kilocalories
- A table of the chosen food groups vs daily intake
