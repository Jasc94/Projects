    "project_description" : "The project tries to answer the question: are our diets efficient? To do this, it analyzes the cost of different food products from the point of view of resources (water, land, pollution), and the nutritional contribution of different foods, in order to check which products are the most efficient. Finally, the project tries to predict the possibility of a user to have or develop a coronary heart disease, mainly based on values related to nutrition. This disease has been chosen because it is the leading cause of mortality in Western countries."
