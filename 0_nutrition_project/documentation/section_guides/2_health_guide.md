This section is divided into three subsections:
- Exploration
- Health prediction
- ML models

<---------------------------- x ---------------------------->

**Exploration**

Filters: Below this expander you can find a table with the information that you will use
- On the left you you can sort the table by variable name or variable description
- You can also choose the variables you want to see: demographics, dietary, etc...
- Once you have done some exploration on the table, you can choose the variables you want insights on:
1. Choose target variable (we recommend one from the questionnaire)
2. Choose the explanatory variables
3. Hit the submit button

Output:
- Insights on the data: More information about the preprocessing and the target variable
- Correlation plot between target variable and independent variables
- Expander with histograms and boxplots for all the independent variables dependent on the target variable

**Health prediction**

Filters: Below this expander you can find a form. By default, it shows the average values, but you can modify them.
- On the left, you can click on "Predict health" once you have filled in the form

Output: it shows whether you are at risk for coronary heart disease based primarily on dietary attributes. It also shows which of the values are above average.


**ML models**

Here you can see the machine learning models used on this data and the different results, as well as the chosen one to make the predictions.
